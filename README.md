# BRSKI-HLPSL
The specification has three agents: the Pledge (P), the registrar (R) and the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority also known as MASA(M). 
HLPSL is a role-based language hence we have specified roles of each agent in the protocol using a set of variable, constant and transitions (called basic roles). Where transitions define the message exchanges between two agents. Then two composite roles are defined known as session and environment. The Composite roles instantiate basic roles to model the entire protocol. A session integrates all roles together to run a valid session of a protocol.
